# Advent of Code - 2022

This is my codes for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I'm doing this challenge in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Keep in mind
that I'm not a rustacean and also I don't almost anything about this language.

I hope to improve this code later.

## How to test

To test this code is simple, run:

```sh
cargo test
```

To be honest the test doesn't do much, just check if the example given by the
advent of code is working.

## How to run

Again, simple thing:

```sh
cargo run
```

This will do the build and start the program.
